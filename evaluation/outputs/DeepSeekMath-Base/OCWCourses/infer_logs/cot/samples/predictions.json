It appears to be an onerous task to prove universality for an arbitrary number of outputs. However, since each individual output of a multi-output function can be considered a separate one-ouput function, it is sufficient to prove the case of only one-output functions. This is why we begin by listing all one-output functions of one variable.\nEach variable $A$ and $B$ has two possible values, making four different combinations of inputs $(A, B)$. Each combination of inputs (four possible) can cause one of two output values. Therefore the number of possible one-output binary functions of two binary variables is $2^{4}$, or \\boxed{16}.

A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part. For example, when implementing boolean logic on a computer chip a universal function (called a 'gate' in logic-speak) can simplify design enormously. We would like to find a universal boolean function. In this problem we will denote the two boolean inputs $A$ and $B$ and the one boolean output as $C$. \nFirst, to help us organize our thoughts, let's enumerate all of the functions we'd like to be able to construct.
